# DH-IGNITE

[DH-IGNITE](https://dh-ignite.org) is a regional South African event that was launched in 2022 by SADiLaR as part of the [ESCALATOR programme](https://escalator.sadilar.org).

The goal of the DH-IGNITE events is to bring researchers and students in humanities and social sciences together and provide opportunities to connect with peers, as well research infrastructure providers, computational researchers, and others. During the two-day event, participants have an opportunity to consider how to incorporate digital and computational research methodologies in their own research through exposure to showcases of various Digital Humanities projects, information sessions about tools and methodologies, panel sessions where existing and upcoming support and initiatives are discussed, and more.

DH-IGNITE is hosted by the ESCALATOR project, which is funded by the Department of Science and Innovation through the [South African Centre for Digital Language Resources (SADiLaR)](https://sadilar.org).
