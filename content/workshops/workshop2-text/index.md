title: "Workshop 2: First steps to text mining
"
summary: |

  ___Presenter:__ Prof Menno van Zaanen (Digital Humanities Professor, SADiLaR)_

  In this workshop we will take a look at some fundamental skills that will get you started on your journey with text mining. To kick off, we will learn how to tell the computer what to search for.  We will start out with simple search operations and explore their limitations. After that, we will look at more complex search operations.  We will also introduce the first data wrangling steps for example converting text data into other formats for further processing. The workshop is accessible to humanities and social sciences students and researchers with no prior exposure to programming. We will not be covering any advanced text mining strategies or tools.  Skills learned will be applicable in other aspects of research such as well, e.g. literature reviews.
