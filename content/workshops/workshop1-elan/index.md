title: "Workshop 1: Introduction to video and audio annotation with ELAN"
summary: |

  ___Presenter:__ Prof Heather Brookes (Chair, Department of General Linguistics, Stellenbosch University)_

  Participants will gain experience in using ELAN to annotate video and audio recordings. No prior experience needed. ELAN (European Distributed Corpora Project Linguistic Annotator) is an annotation tool that allows users to create, edit, visualise and search annotations for video and audio data. ELAN is specifically designed for the analysis of language, sign language, and gestures, but it can be used for multi-media, video and/or audio data, for the purposes of annotation, analysis and documentation.

## What to expect

Participants will gain experience in using ELAN to annotate video and audio recordings. No prior experience needed. With ELAN a user can add an unlimited number of textual annotations to audio and/or video recordings. An annotation can be a sentence, word or gloss, a comment, translation or a description of any feature observed in the media. Annotations can be created on multiple layers, called tiers. Tiers can be hierarchically interconnected. An annotation can either be time-aligned to the media or it can refer to other existing annotations. The content of annotations consists of Unicode text and annotation documents are stored in an [XML format (EAF)](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan).
