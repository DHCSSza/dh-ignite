title: "Workshop 1: Introduction to video and audio annotation with ELAN"
summary: |

  ___Presenter:__ Prof Heather Brookes (Chair, Department of General Linguistics, Stellenbosch University)_

  Participants will gain experience in using ELAN to annotate video and audio recordings. No prior experience needed. ELAN (European Distributed Corpora Project Linguistic Annotator) is an annotation tool that allows users to create, edit, visualise and search annotations for video and audio data. ELAN is specifically designed for the analysis of language, sign language, and gestures, but it can be used for multi-media, video and/or audio data, for the purposes of annotation, analysis and documentation.
