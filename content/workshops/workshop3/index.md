title: "Workshop 3:  Using computational tools for translating text (Autshumato)"
summary: |

  ___Presenter:__ Laurinda van Tonder (Applied Linguistics, UJ)_

  Autshumato is a collection of open-source (free) translation tools funded by the Department of Sports, Arts and Culture (DSAC) and developed by CTexT. The Autshumato Integrated Translation Environment (ITE)  includes access to translation memories, machine translation and glossaries to help translators do their work more effectively. It can be adapted to aid translation between any two languages.	The workshop will introduce participants to using computational methods to assist translation activities. At the end of the session, participants will be able to use the Autshumato ITE as a tool to do translations on their own laptops.

**Presenter:** Laurinda van Tonder, Applied Linguistics, UJ

**Date:** 25 August 2023

**Time:** 8:30 - 12:30

**Venue:** Room (TBC), Premier Hotel O.R. Tambo, Johannesburg

**Max capacity:** 30 participants

**Eligibility:** Workshop participation is open to attendees of DH-IGNITE at no cost. Limited space is available. Successful DH-IGNITE applicants will be invited to register for either one of the workshops.

**What to bring:** A laptop

## Workshop aim

The workshop aims to introduce participants to using computational methods to assist translation activities. At the end of the session, participants will be able to use the Autshumato ITE as a tool to do translations on their own laptops. 	

## Workshop format

The workshop will provide a combination of presentations, demos and practical hands-on exercises. 
 
## Participants who would be interested in attending

Language practitioners, team members of language units, students interested in translation studies, researchers, scholars, linguists and lecturers.

## Topics that will be included

- What is Autshumato and who is CTexT
- What not to expect
- Getting started with Autshumato ITE - Translation of test documents


## Workshop outcome

After following this workshop, you will be able to perform the following actions:

- Open documents and save translated documents in original format (e.g. on a letterhead)
- Define source and target languages
- Use tags (to keep formatting such as bold or italic text)
- Translate text in easily editable ‘chunks’ (sentences or paragraphs)
- Build up glossaries (lists of previously translated words)
- Access the translation memory (larger segments of previously translated texts)
- Insert diacritics (special characters used in some languages).
