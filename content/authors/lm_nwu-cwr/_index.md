A vision for digital and computational research in humanities and social sciences

## Bio

My name is Lebona Cedric Mafisa, Language Practitioner, postgraduate student at North – West University (Vanderbijlpark Campus) affiliated to Research Unit (Language & Literature in the South African Context). My research focus is Sesotho Literature with emphasis on essays and philosophy; I am keen to learn more about Digital Humanities in order to assist Sesotho to advance to greater heights in this field.
