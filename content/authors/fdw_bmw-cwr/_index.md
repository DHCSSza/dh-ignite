Welcome & opening

## Abstract

Despite many attempts to address the situation, South Africa's official languages remain under-resourced in terms of the text and speech data required to implement state-of-the-art language technology. To ensure that "no language is left behind", resource development should remain a priority until a strong digital presence has been established for all indigenous languages. This talk will report an ongoing initiative to strengthen the presence of South African languages on the Mozilla Common Voice platform.
