## Session

Growing a community of practice around digital and computational research in humanities and social sciences

## Abstract

In this presentation we will share an overview of the [ESCALATOR programme](https://escalator.sadilar.org) of which DH-IGNITE is one of the activities. ESCALATOR is a programme run by SADiLaR to support the development of a community of practice within humanities and social sciences around the use of digital methodologies in humanities/social sciences research. The programme kicked off at the end of 2020 at the hight of the COVID pandemic. We will share some of the design decisions of the programme, lessons learned and success stories and a future vision.
