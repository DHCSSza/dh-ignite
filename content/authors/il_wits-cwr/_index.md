## Session

Case-studies: Showcasing examples of humanities/social sciences research projects with computational/digital element

## Abstract

This talk showcases how computational methods such as R programming can facilitate the exploration of the social effect of Own-Race bias. This powerful computational method not only illuminates the psychological and societal significance of this phenomenon but also shows the importance and usefulness of applying digital tools within social science research.
