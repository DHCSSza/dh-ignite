## Session

Resources and opportunities for learning and teaching digital and computational skills

## Abstract

Crossing a river, when you are far from a bridge, is to look for where the water is shallow. This is an analogy that works well for the training we provide. This presentation will give a brief overview of the CODATA-RDA  School of Research Data Science - Pretoria, training event. The philosophy, the tools and our strengths will be shared with the audience.
