A vision for digital and computational research in humanities and social sciences

## Bio

I am a third-year student at UJ, pursuing a BA in Humanities with a major in Linguistics. Alongside my linguistic studies, i have a creative side as a passionate photographer, capturing the beauty of the world through my lens. I am also actively involved in community engagement at UJ, demonstrating my commitment to making a positive impact in the lives of others. With my multidisciplinary background and dedication to both linguistics and community service, i strive to bridge the gap between language and culture, promoting understanding and inclusivity.
