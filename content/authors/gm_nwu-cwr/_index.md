Lessons learned from doing interdisciplinary research

## Abstract

Eye tracking is a methodology that lets a person track the eye movements of individuals while they interact with stimuli. Given that what we look at is what we process (also known as the mind-eye hypothesis) makes eye-tracking a true multi-disciplinary methodology that can contribute to research in any field that needs to measure individuals’ interaction. These include reading, gaming, medical practices, translation studies, website usability, sport, educational material and many more.

In 2010, Dr Gordon Matthew attained a BA-degree in Computational Linguistics at the North-West University’s (NWU’s) Potchefstroom Campus. In 2013, he attained a MA-degree in Linguistics and Literary Theory at the NWU’s Vaal Triangle Campus, the thesis topic focusing on the development of an Afrikaans Named Entity Recognizer. Gordon is part of the UPSET Focus area, and words specifically on Audio-Visual translation (specifically subtitles) and Eye Tracking.
