## Session

Resources and opportunities for learning and teaching digital and computational skills

## Abstract

The Carpentries, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, trains and fosters an active, inclusive, diverse community of novice learners and experienced Instructors to promote and model the importance of software and data in research. We collaboratively develop openly-available lessons and deliver these lessons using evidence-based teaching practices, focusing on people conducting and supporting research. This talk will outline how the organisation and the community surrounding it realises this work.
