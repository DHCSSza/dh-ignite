## Session

South African infrastructure for digital/computational research


## Abstract

The Centre for High Performance Computing (CHPC) represents a key computing research infrastructure offering for all research domain areas, including Humanities.  In the talk a brief overview will be provided on how the CHPC is successfully supporting and depended on by mostly scientific and engineering research areas.  The goal is to use this background to evaluate and discuss the potential role the CHPC can play to support the computing and data processing needs of Digital Humanities research programmes.
