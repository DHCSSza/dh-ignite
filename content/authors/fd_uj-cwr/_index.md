## Session

Resources and opportunities for learning and teaching digital and computational skills

## Abstract

The shift to a knowledge-driven economy with a great emphasis on critical thinking is driving demand for a highly skilled, creative, and flexible workforce. The understanding of the impact of digital technology on pedagogy within academic learning spaces is an important topic to consider and also in the long run will be significant for many people in education. Places are pedagogic (Hickey, 2012) and space is relational. The current move to redesigning physical learning spaces is representative of a view that infrastructure plays a crucial role in shaping teaching practices in higher education institutions in South Africa and internationally.
