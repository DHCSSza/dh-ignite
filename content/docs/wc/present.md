## Lightning talks
---

A Lightning talk is a short (no longer than 5 minutes) presentation covering only a tiny focus area of your research or idea. Through the lightning talk session, we want to give researchers and students an opportunity to share with others what they are working on, what they have learned, how they are using digital and computational tools or practices in their research, and more.

Guidelines are available at <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mtp7kC1flpJ4mBcPP7sJmuwH8rQ0UG3U8MU1nVKiZCM/edit?usp=sharing>.
