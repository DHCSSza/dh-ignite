DH-IGNITE will use the Zoom Events platform to host the meeting. Zoom Events simulates a physical conference by offering a virtual "lobby" and "expo space".

Exhibitors are welcome to request a virtual booth to showcase their work.

Virtual and in-person participants will have access to the virtual booths.
