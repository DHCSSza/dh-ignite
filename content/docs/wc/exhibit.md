Full guidelines for exhibitors wanting to make use of the virtual booth option are [available online](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1in570FOylftT4jrcSIausp9GtGL9dc3UDMav1HvcBdI/edit?usp=sharing).

DH-IGNITE will use the Zoom Events platform to host the meeting. Zoom Events simulates a physical conference by offering a virtual "lobby" and "expo space".

Exhibitors are welcome to request a virtual booth to showcase their work.

Virtual and in-person participants will have access to the virtual booths.

## Costs

Exhibitors will not be charged a fee to exhibit their work but will be liable for paying conference day fees (tea breaks and lunch are included), parking, travel and accommodation (including breakfast and dinner) for each team member joining the exhibition.

## Joining as exhibitor

### By invitation

The DH-IGNITE team will invite potential exhibitors to showcase their work, products or services. These nominated organisations will receive an invitation email from the DH-IGNITE team.


### By application

Please [contact us](../../../#contact) if you have not received an invitation but would like to exhibit your work at the conference. In your email, please include the following information:

- The institution or company you are representing
- A short description of the work you will be exhibiting 
- The number of team members that will be joining you to exhibit
- Information about your needs for the exhibition (e.g. table, electricity, etc.). The DH-IGNITE team will arrange for an exhibition venue, but exhibitors will be responsible for their setup and additional resources.
