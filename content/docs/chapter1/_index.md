## Background

In 2020 the [South African Center for Digital Language Resources](https://sadilar.org) (SADiLaR) launched the [ESCALATOR programme](https://escalator.sadilar.org) as part of the DSI-funded SARIR research infrastructure.

ESCALATOR aims to support the development of an inclusive and active community of practice in Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences in South Africa. Read more about the programme on our website - https://escalator.sadilar.org.

## Original plans

The ESCALATOR team set out with great excitement and planned to run numerous in-person capacity and community development events across the country, but restrictions related to the COVID pandemic hampered much of our activities and we were unable to host in-person workshops, networking events, and more. Despite the challenges, numerous virtual activities did take place and we are looking forward to meeting our participants in person at the regional DH-IGNITE events over the coming months.

## So what is DH-IGNITE?

DH-IGNITE is a _**2-day hybrid event**_ designed to create an opportunity for those interested in _**digital and computational methods and practices in humanities and social sciences**_ to:

- learn about _opportunities and resources_ available through ESCALATOR, SADiLaR, and others in the local and global community;
- _showcase_ their work;
- _meet_ peers at similar learning stages;
- _connect_ with others for potential future collaboration;
- _advertise_ postgraduate study opportunities;
- _brain storm_ ideas for digital innovation in their research projects;
- much more!


## When and where will DH-IGNITE take place?

The original plan with ESCALATOR was to reach out to all public universities in South Africa by hosting various in-person networking and capacity development activities on the various campuses in collaboration with the host institutions.

With COVID restrictions being lifted, we are innovating to reach a broader audience in a shorter time and offer even better opportunities for networking and community building.

We will host **SIX** DH-IGNITE events across the country between August 2022 and May 2023. Each event will be open to institutions based in specific regions:
