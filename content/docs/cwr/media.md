## In-person event
---

DH-IGNITE Western & Central Region is the first DH-IGNITE to be hosted entirely in person with no option to join virtually. As we are unable to accommodate a large number of people, we have contracted a media company to assist with recording the event to share it online afterwards.

By attending the event, participants acknowledge that they will be recorded for purposes of the event being shared internally with other participants as well as openly on platforms such as YouTube.


## Media
---

This is the third of several DH-IGNITE events to take place across South Africa over the coming months. We would like to capture moments in the event for future marketing, sharing the experience with those who are not able to participate, reports, and various online and printed articles.

We realise not everyone wants to be recorded or photographed and will be mindful of this before sharing recordings or photos outside of the event.

__At registration, please indicate if you prefer not to appear on photos or recordings made of the event, for purposes of sharing beyond registered participants, speakers, and exhibitors.__

## Taking your own photos
---

Please be mindful of people's preference not to be photographed if you are taking photos or videos of the event.
