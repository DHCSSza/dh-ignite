## Laptops/Desktops
---

### In-person

All in-person participants are encouraged to bring along a laptop if possible. We will be engaging with virtual participants, speakers, and exhibitors online. We will also be running two hands-on training sessions that will require a laptop rather than a mobile device (phone, tablet). If you are unable to bring a laptop, we will encourage participants to team up and sit with participants who do have a device available.

### Virtual participants

Virtual participants are encouraged to use a desktop or laptop for the duration of the DH-IGNITE event to have the best possible, emmersive experience and engage optimally with physical and virtual speakers, participants, and exhibitors.


## Hybrid event - Zoom Events
---

DH-IGNITE KZN is taking place in a hybrid format - participants, speakers, and exhibitors will either be present in-person or online. To ensure everyone has a great experience and can participate equally, we have contracted a media company to assist with recording and broadcasting via the [Zoom Events platform](../).

Participants are encouraged to ensure they have the latest version of Zoom installed. The Zoom Events platform will be used for virtual and in-person participation to facilate networking between in-person and virtual participants, speakers, and exhibitors, communicate about programme updates, share information about speakers, and more.

## Voyant
---

During the skills development session on 19 October, we will run a hands-on tutorial on [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/) - a web-based reading and analysis environment for digital texts. The software may be of use to people not directly involved in language research too.

{{< icon name="info-circle" pack="fas" >}} __There is no need to install anything for the Voyant tutorial.__

## OpenRefine
---

During the second part of the skills development session on 19 October, we will run a hands-on tutorial on [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) - a __FREE__ powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with web services and external data.


OpenRefine can be used in a wide range of contexts and is not limited to any research discipline. 

{{< icon name="info-circle" pack="fas" >}} __Please install the latest version of OpenRefine (version 3.6.1) on your device.__

- Download from: https://openrefine.org/download.html
