ESCALATOR is a project run by the [South African Centre for Digital Language Resources](https://www.sadilar.org/) (SADiLaR) and therefore abides by the SADiLaR [code of conduct as published on their website](https://www.sadilar.org/index.php/en/proposals-and-workshops/request-a-workshop/code-of-conduct).

The code of conduct does not only apply to in-person workshops, but extends to all engagements related to ESCALATOR including but not limited to:

- in person events of all types
- online activities such as conferences, workshops, presentations, colloquia
- meetings
- email communication
- social media communication

In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all platforms and events:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members


**\*\*_PLEASE NOTE_: By participating in this programme, participants accept to abide by the [SADiLaR code of conduct](https://sadilar.org/index.php/en/guidelines-standards/code-of-conduct).**\*\*
