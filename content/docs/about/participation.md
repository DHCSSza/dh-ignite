## Through application (in person)
---

- Anyone who is interested to join the event in person and is affiliated with one of the relevant regional institutions, may apply to participate.
- Participants will be selected based on the quality of their application - how likely they are to benefit from and contribute to the event. Applicants will not be penalised for limited computational or digital research experience if they can convey their interest to learn and show how they will contribute to the growing community of practice during or after the event.
- SADiLaR will sponsor the conference day fee (venue, lunch, tea breaks, parking). Participants will be responsible for funding accommodation, transport, and incidentals (whichever is relevant). 
- Participants will be liable for a no-show fee if they do not attend the full event without sufficient warning or valid reasons.
